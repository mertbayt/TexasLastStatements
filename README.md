I used a library called gensim to utilize machine learning algorithms to create a dictionary/corpus of words and a bag of words based on Texas Last Statements data. From there I analyzed your inputted statements and again used machine learning to find the most similar words in the bag of words to your inputted statements. Percentages are given to how similar a word is. Furthermore, I utilized Latent Dirichlet allocation machine learning algorithms to perform topic analysis of each last statement. This found topic word(s) that encapsulated the statement. Percentages are given to how similar a topic word is to the statement.
